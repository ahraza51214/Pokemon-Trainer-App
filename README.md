# PokemonTrainerApp
A Pokémon Trainer web app using the Angular Framework. The application allows a user to collect Pokémon received from the PokeAPI. Users must enter username 
before being able to collect any Pokémon. Users must also be able to view the Pokémon that have been 
collected in their own trainer page.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
